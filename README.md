# bank-tech-test
This project is a tech test - for Bank.
1.Understand the Requirements: Read and understand the requirements of the tech test thoroughly. Clarify any doubts or questions you may have before starting.

2.Set Up Your Development Environment: Ensure that you have a suitable development environment for JavaScript programming. You can use any code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
3. Plan Your Approach: Break down the problem or task into smaller parts and plan your approach accordingly. Consider the logic and steps needed to solve the problem.
Create a New Project: Set up a new project folder on your computer to organize your test code. Use a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) to initialize a new project. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and run the following command:
csharp

npm init -y

This will create a package.json file, which will track your project dependencies.
Install Dependencies: If the tech test requires any specific libraries or frameworks, install them using npm. For example, if you need to use a testing library like Jest, you can install it by running the following command:

npm install jest
Create Test Files: Create a new JavaScript file or multiple files to write your test cases. You can use a naming convention like test.js or test.spec.js to indicate that these files contain tests. These files will usually have a structure that includes test suites and individual test cases.
Write Test Cases: Start writing your test cases based on the requirements or specifications provided in the tech test. Use testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine to define your test suites and assertions. Write tests that cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Run Your Tests: Once you have written your test cases, you can run them to verify if they pass or fail. Use the testing framework's command-line interface or a test runner to execute your tests. For example, with Jest, you can run the following command:
Copy code
npx jest
Refine and Iterate: Review the test results and make any necessary changes or updates to your code or test cases. Refine your implementation and repeat the testing process until you are confident that your solution is correct.
Submit Your Test: Once you have completed the tech test and are satisfied with your solution, submit your code as per the instructions provided. Ensure that you include any additional documentation or instructions if required.
